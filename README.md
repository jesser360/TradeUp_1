# TradeUP
## A Ruby on Rails Trading App

TradeUP is based on the story of a Canadian blogger named [Kyle MacDonald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_red_paperclip) who bartered his way from a single red paperclip to a house in a series of fourteen online trades over the course of a year. This story inspired our group to build a Craigslist-style trading app that encourages users to continue trading up to see the limitless possibilities that they can get.
