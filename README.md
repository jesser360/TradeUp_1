## A Ruby on Rails Trading App

TradeUP is based on the story of a Canadian blogger named [Kyle MacDonald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_red_paperclip) who bartered his way from a single red paperclip to a house in a series of fourteen online trades over the course of a year. This story inspired our group to build a Craigslist-style trading app that encourages users to continue trading up to see the limitless possibilities that they can get.

## Technologies
- Ruby
- Rails
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

##  Cool features

- FFaker (Seed data assistant)
- Area (A gem to parse city names from zipcodes!)
- Custom background color on user profile pages

## Tricky code



## Model ERD

We originally moved forward with the following wireframes in an orange & green color scheme to match the custom logo:
#### Home page

#### Item show page

However, the General Assembly UX designers made a few suggestions that we took to heart, and instead, our app ended up looking like this:
