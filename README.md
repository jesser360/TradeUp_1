## A Ruby on Rails Trading App

TradeUP is based on the story of a Canadian blogger named [Kyle MacDonald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_red_paperclip) who bartered his way from a single red paperclip to a house in a series of fourteen online trades over the course of a year. This story inspired our group to build a Craigslist-style trading app that encourages users to continue trading up to see the limitless possibilities that they can get.

## User Story

1. A user can sign up, log in, customize their profile, and post an item, experience, or service to trade.
2. A user can browse trades by category and save them to their favorites.
3. A user can initiate a trade by offering up an item, service, or experience they have created previously.
4. A user can receive trades offers and either request or decline to pursue to it.
5. If accepted, the initiator and receiver both gain access to each other's personal information to proceed with meeting up and finalizing details.
6. Users can rate each other post-transaction on a scale of 1-5.

## The Design Evolution

We originally moved forward with the following wireframes in an orange & green color scheme to match the custom logo:
#### Home page

#### Sign In page

#### Item show page

However, the General Assembly UX designers made a few suggestions that we took to heart, and instead, our app ended up looking like this:

## Features to be added later
- A messaging system so that users can discuss the trade further with each other through the site.
- Incorporating more UX design ideas, such as additional infographics.
- Tighten up error handling, better use of SweetAlerts, better authorization for certain offer capabilities.
